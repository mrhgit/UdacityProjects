# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

_**Special Notes:  Please don't consider running through the projects as a substitute for watching the videos and doing the activities that precede the projects.  In some cases, the time spent on the projects may actually be LESS than the time spent absorbing the material Udacity provides as a precursor.  In that sense, what is presented here might seem disconnected or lacking in the background material necessary to complete the projects with a full appreciation of the techniques or algorithms used.  Additionally, the projects were expected to be run in the confines of an particular Anaconda environment.  Both Machine Learning (especially neural networks) AND the libraries written to implement them are evolving rapidly and you're likely to have some issues running the code in these projects with modern versions of the Python modules used.**_

The Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree offered by Udacity in 2017 was next on my list of courses to take, after having previously completed Machine Learning Nanodegree.  The MLND covered classical marchine learning and introduced neural networks.  The AIND did something similar in that it covered classical artificial intelligence and ventured more heavily into neural networks (such as using RNNs and GANs).

An important note is that many of the projects in the AIND were automatically graded, so there may only be filled-out, TODO sections instead of a report.

## Projects
Below is the list of projects from the course, along with links to my solutions.  In each directory, you'll find a README.md written by Udacity, along with some of their helper code.  Generally, the student's view of the project is the Jupyter Notebook files with an .ipynb extension (viewable in GitHub), which is where you'll find the string of guidance, activities, and Q&A that make up the project.  Sometimes, I had to fill in TODO sections in a separate code file.
