# Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree

_**Special Notes:  Please don't consider running through the projects as a substitute for watching the videos and doing the activities that precede the projects.  In some cases, the time spent on the projects may actually be LESS than the time spent absorbing the material Udacity provides as a precursor.  In that sense, what is presented here might seem disconnected or lacking in the background material necessary to complete the projects with a full appreciation of the techniques or algorithms used.  Additionally, the projects were expected to be run in the confines of an particular Anaconda environment.  Both Machine Learning (especially neural networks) AND the libraries written to implement them are evolving rapidly and you're likely to have some issues running the code in these projects with modern versions of the Python modules used.**_

The Flying Car Nanodegree offered by Udacity in 2018 was a whimsical pursuit to satisfy my craving for learning more from Udacity's wonderful programs.  Unfortunately, this program was cut short after a single term.  I'm not sure where it stands now.  The projects focused around controller quadcopter drones inside a nicely-built simulator designed by Udacity.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a few tricks along the way.

## Projects
Below is the list of projects from the course, along with links to my solutions.  In each directory, you'll find a README.md written by Udacity, along with some of their helper code.  Generally, the student's view of the project is the Jupyter Notebook files with an .ipynb extension (viewable in GitHub), which is where you'll find the string of guidance, activities, and Q&A that make up the project.  Sometimes, I had to fill in TODO sections in a separate code file.
