# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

The Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity in 2017 was a great course to follow my previous run-through of Kirill Eremenko's fantastic "Machine Learnings A-Z" course on Udemy.

It was my first Nanodegree.  My reasons for choosing a Udacity Nanodegree were that it was supposed to something graded (i.e. earned) and was a chance to learn more while practicing ML and getting feedback from those who knew better than I did.  Generally, I'd say my expectations were met.

The best part of the course are the video instruction and all the legwork that was done to set up project frameworks such that I could focus on the "meat" of the problems.  It was a luxurious experience.  The downside of this approach is that sometimes it can feel like a simplistic, "fill in the blank" problem, however I felt truly engaged and wanting for an enriching experienced which kept me for just trying to find the simplest answer (OK, most of the time anyway).

Speaking of projects, here is the list of projects from the course, along with a link to my solutions:
