# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

The Machine Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity in 2017 was a great course to follow my previous run-through of Kirill Eremenko's fantastic "Machine Learning A-Z" course on Udemy.

It was my first Nanodegree.  My reasons for choosing a Udacity Nanodegree were that it was supposed to be something graded (read "earned") and was a chance to learn more while practicing ML and getting feedback from those who knew better than I did.  Generally, I'd say my expectations were met.

The best part of the course are the video instruction and all the legwork that was done to set up project frameworks such that I could focus on the "meat" of the problems.  It was a luxurious experience.  The downside of this approach is that sometimes it can feel like a simplistic, "fill in the blank" problem, however I felt truly engaged and wanting for an enriching experienced which kept me for just trying to find the simplest answer (OK, most of the time anyway).

## Projects
Speaking of projects, here is the list of projects from the course, along with links to my solutions.  In each directory, you'll find a README.md written by Udacity, along with some of their helper code.  Generally, the student's view of the project is the Jupyter Notebook files with an .ipynb extension (viewable in GitHub), which is where you'll find the string of guidance, activities, and Q&A that make up the project.  Sometimes, I had to fill in TODO sections in a separate code file.  Most of it is in Python, using primarily pandas and matplotlib.

### [Titanic Survival Exploration](./titanic_survival_exploration)
What a great opening project!  It's fun, easy to imagine and comes with lots of interesting data.  What's a budding data scientist not to love?  The goals, as the project progresses, are to 1) understand the data and 2) come up with a model to predict survival.  In the end, a score of 80% does the trick.
